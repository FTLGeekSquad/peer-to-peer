## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 This week my group was able to finish alot of features and extra details we wanted to add. We fixed the saved listing and made it more detailed, aswell as the user profile.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 My group experienced merge conflicts, we were able to overcome this with much debbugging and learned throught the way new git terminal commands.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We finished most of our plans, exept responsive design and making sure our deployed website on render works. We are going to work together instead of separate to accomplish more, starting now.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes the free time, gave us the opportunity to go to monitors and collaborate with our peers and get a feel of what it's like working in a technical developers environment.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 A feature I would consider at risk would be google oa, We were having issues while deploying the site and decided to saty in local host, hopefully wee are able to fix it this weekend so it works by monday.
