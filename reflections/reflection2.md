## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 One major success we had this week was implementing new APIs that we haven't used on previous projects, specifically the AWS S3 bucket and Google Oath for our user authentication. Successfully incorporating these features into the front end for user experience, but also in the backend for database storage enhances our website's functionality

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

One challenge our group faced this week efficiently and effectively handling merges. There were multiple instances when something worked on one computer, but after merging we would have to make changes so that the feature wouldn't crash our website. In the future, we want to make sure we have successful projects on all devices

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We finished all of the essentials for the MVP of our project, but we did not finish all the tasks in the sprint plan. Specifically, we still want to work on CSS, responsive design. and fully deploying frontend and backend and incorporating that into our code. Furthermore, we hope to add the calendar implementation and user reviews for each listing

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes, the resources provided throughout the sprint helped in planning and executing the project. The most helpful resources were our instructors and peers. They were especially helpful with debugging components that we were not as familiar with, and to get conceptual help before implementing features

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

A feature that could potentially be "at risk" is the calendar component of our website. Because it is a stretch feature, we will only start on it after we have a version that we would all feel comfortable enough presenting as our final product in case we don't have enough time to complete that feature.
