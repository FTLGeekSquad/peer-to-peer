## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 Home page styling!
 Search Bar Functionality!
 Fetching listings with appropriate categories/sub-categories.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

  Ensure the Sub Category Toggle Buttons worked correctly.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

  We did not complete the profile page(s) and the implementation.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

  Yes, the resources helped especially the lecture on Google OAuth and the past projects.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?
