## Problem Statement

Photography enthusiasts often face high costs and limited availability when trying to access specialized photography equipment for short-term use. Whereas, photography professionals often under utilize their photography equipment. This occurs since there is no platform that allows peer to peer rental of photography equipment. 


## Description

The main purpose of our project is to create a peer-to-peer photography rental website that addresses the challenges faced by both photography enthusiasts and professionals. Our site will have three main categories: equipment, spaces, and services. Users with an account can list their photography gear, studios, and services for rent, or find and rent those resources from others. Our platform will enable enthusiasts to access photography equipment, spaces, and services affordably in the short term, while allowing professionals to monetize underutilized equipment.

What similar apps and websites? How will your project stand out from these other websites?
Similar App: https://www.lensrentals.com/
    Although this application allows for photography equipment rental, it is not peer to peer nor based on local availability as the rented items are shipped.
Similar App:https://www.sharegrid.com/sfbay
    Although this is similar, ours will provide an emphasis on peer to peer and renting vs buying/selling. In contrast to this site, it will be an emphasis on allowing rentals for people who are not in the professional realm.
